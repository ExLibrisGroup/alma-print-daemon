# alma-print-daemon
The Alma Print Daemon is an Alma extension that helps you to automatically print letters and slips from the Alma print queues.  With this new print daemon extension there is no need to use email based printing.  It will also automatically update itself when new versions are available for easy management and upkeep.

The extension's configuration options include:

- region (Asia Pacific, Canada, China, Europe, North America)
- API key (read permission for Configuration, read/write permissions for Task-lists
- Alma Printer Queues from which to print
- Local Printer (workstation default printer is the implied default)
- Automatic interval printing (in minutes) or manual on-demand printing

Microsoft Windows version available initially, Macintosh version planned to follow.
